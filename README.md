# LottoResultsDemo
Lightweight application that displays the results of Lotto played in Germany 

Technical Requirements: 
- Xcode 26.0.1

This project demonstrates a scalable iOS application built with a strong emphasis on MVVM Architecture and SOLID principles. The goal was to design an app that not only meets current requirements but is also future-proof, modular, and easy to extend as business needs evolve.

By separating concerns into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, and Data), the codebase achieves:
Maintainability – clear boundaries and contracts
Scalability – easily adaptable to new features or external dependencies
Reusability – components designed to be modular and replaceable


Architecture & Principles:
MVVM Architecture → Enforces strict boundaries between layers.
SOLID Principles → Ensures high cohesion and low coupling.


Future Scope:
The project is structured with scalability in mind, enabling the following enhancements:
- UI Testing → End-to-end validation of user flows. There are still many UI test cases to be written
- Unit Testing → Extensive coverage for use cases, repositories, and view models.
- Mocking & Stubs → Replace external dependencies in tests for deterministic results.
- Dependency Injection (DI) → Adopt DI frameworks or lightweight containers for better testability and configurability.
- Modularization → Break down into feature-based modules for even greater scalability.
- Proper Comments
